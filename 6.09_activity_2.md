# 6.09 Activity 2

For this activity we will use the file `files_for_activities/a_b_testing_data.csv`. Follow the steps to create a pivot table. Through the pivot table we want to be able to present the data in a more readable format. We want to analyze the difference between the test variation and control variation by total balance and total client tenures for each step of the process.

- This is what the file would look like initially: [link to the image - Pivot Table 1](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/6.09/6.09-pivot_table1.png)
  Note that the data has filter on the `gender` column. We have only selected the `M` and `F` values and filtered out the rest.

- There are two columns: `Total Sum of bal` and `Total sum of client tnr yr`. Hide these columns.
- You would notice that the values in the columns are whole numbers, which are not very easy to interpret. Convert the numbers into percentage of total: [link to the image - Pivot Table 2](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/6.09/6.09-pivot_table2.png)
- Add another column in the pivot table for `total count of num accts`.
- Rearrange the row labels so that the process steps are in the following order `start`, `step_1`, `step_2`, `step_3`, and `confirm`.
- The final output should look like this: [link to the image - Pivot Table 2](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/6.09/6.09-pivot_table3.png)
