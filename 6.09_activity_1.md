# 6.09 Activity 1

In this activity, you will be using the `files_for_activities/lesson_1_file_with_end.xlsm`.

In this activity we will work on the same file from the previous lab - the `deduction_import_raw.xls`. We have received some new inputs from the payroll team. They need some additional information in the output.
From the raw data, they need information from the column AP Coverage Start Date. It is important to note that the way they need to input the information from this column is one month prior to the actual date in the column. For eg if the actual date in column AP is 1/1/2020 , they need it as 12/1/2019 in the output file.
This date is preceded by vertical bar (repeated six times) before the date and three times after the date
This is how the final output should look like: link to the image - [Expected Final Output](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/6.09-updated_expected_final_output.png).
